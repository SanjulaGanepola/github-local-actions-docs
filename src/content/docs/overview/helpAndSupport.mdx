## Report an Issue

If you ever run into an issue, please report it by [opening an issue](https://github.com/SanjulaGanepola/github-local-actions/issues). It is recommended to do this directly in VS Code by navigating to any view and selecting the **Report an Issue** option under the **Help and Support** submenu.

Selecting this option will prompt you for various things to include in the bug report. Some options will only be visible as long as you have all components running and a workflow opened in the editor. Upon selecting the relevant pieces of information to include, you will be taken to the GitHub issue page where a bug report template has been populated. From here, you can then modify and submit the issue.
