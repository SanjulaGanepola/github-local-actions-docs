## Configuration

To use artifact-related actions like `actions/upload-artifact` or `actions/cache`, you need to configure an artifact server path.

### Setting up the artifact server

1. Open the extension sidebar
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Options**
3. Click the **+** button
4. Search for `artifact-server-path`
5. Set the value to a local directory path appropriate for your OS, for example:
    - Linux/macOS: `/tmp/artifacts`
    - Windows: `%TEMP%\artifacts`
    Ensure the directory exists and is writeable.
6. Save the configuration
7. Select the option to include it in your next run

### Why is this needed?

GitHub Actions provides environment variables (`ACTIONS_RUNTIME_TOKEN`, `ACTIONS_RUNTIME_URL`, `ACTIONS_CACHE_URL`) that artifact actions rely on. When running locally, these are not available by default. The `--artifact-server-path` option configures a local artifact server to handle these operations.

Without the artifact server configuration, this workflow will fail with an error in the logs similar to:
```text:
❗ ::error::Unable to get the ACTIONS_RUNTIME_TOKEN env variable
```
