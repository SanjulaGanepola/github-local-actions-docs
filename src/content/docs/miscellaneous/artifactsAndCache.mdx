## Configuration

To use artifact-related actions like `actions/upload-artifact`, you need to configure an artifact server path.

### Configuration Options

The following options can be configured to set up local artifact and cache servers:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--artifact-server-addr` | Defines the address to which the artifact server binds |
| `--artifact-server-path` | Defines the path where the artifact server stores uploads and retrieves downloads from. If not specified, the artifact server will not start |
| `--artifact-server-port` | Defines the port where the artifact server listens |
| `--cache-server-addr` | Defines the address to which the cache server binds |
| `--cache-server-path` | Defines the path where the cache server stores caches |
| `--cache-server-port` | Defines the port where the cache server listens. 0 means a randomly available port |

### Setting up artifact and cache servers

1. Navigate to the **Settings** view
2. Click the **+** button on the **Options** heading to add a new option
3. Add the desired configuration options from the table above
4. For each option, set an appropriate value
5. Select the options to include them in your next run

### Why is this needed?

GitHub Actions provides environment variables (`ACTIONS_RUNTIME_TOKEN`, `ACTIONS_RUNTIME_URL`, `ACTIONS_CACHE_URL`) that artifact actions rely on. When running locally, these are not available by default. The `--artifact-server-path` option configures a local artifact server to handle these operations.

Without the artifact server configuration, this workflow will fail with an error in the logs similar to:
```text
❗ ::error::Unable to get the ACTIONS_RUNTIME_TOKEN env variable
```
